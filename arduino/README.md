# Seismometer

The seismometer uses an analog to digital converter (ADC) device to convert the voltage created by the seismometer coil to digital data. The ADC is wired up to Arduino microcontroller that reads the data and takes care of time synchronization. Arduino then sends the prepared data to ZejfCSeis via USB connection.

Currently, 2 highly accurate ADC's are supported: 24-bit ADS1256 and 32-bit ADS1263 and more can be easily added.
